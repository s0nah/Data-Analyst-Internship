Methodology and Assumptions:

Initial DataFrame: The initial DataFrame has columns representing employee data, including employee code, manager employee code, dates of joining and exit, compensation, review ratings, and engagement scores over time.

Data Transformation: Functions are defined to extract the last known compensation and the date of the last pay raise for each employee. These functions are applied to create new columns in the DataFrame.

Column Definition: Additional columns are defined to represent various aspects of employee data, such as variable pay, tenure in the organization, performance rating, engagement score, effective date, and end date.

Column Dropping: Unnecessary columns related to individual compensation, reviews, and engagements are dropped after consolidating data into summary columns. This reduces redundancy and improves data clarity.

Data Repeating: Rows are repeated for each change in compensation, review, and engagement to ensure that each period has consistent data. This allows for a granular analysis of employee data over time.

Manager Employee Code Modification: The manager employee code is modified for repeated rows to maintain consistency in the representation of managerial relationships across periods.

End Date Calculation: The end date for each period is calculated as one day before the next effective date for each employee. This ensures that periods do not overlap and that each period represents a distinct time frame.

Handling Missing Data: Missing data for a specific period is assumed to be inherited from the most recent past record for the same employee. This assumption maintains consistency within each employee's historical data.

Overall, this methodology aims to create a structured and comprehensive historical analysis table from the initial employee data, ensuring consistency, clarity, and appropriate handling of missing data and time periods.
